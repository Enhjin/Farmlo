### Summary of the Project
Our project is similar to that of an “escape room,” where the agent must find an exit of a room, where the room is provided as an input, within a reasonable amount of time. However, the agent must avoid death as there is a fire that spreads throughout the map and should aim to recover resources along the way. As a result, dying is equivalent to a penalty and recovering resources and finding exits within a short amount of time (or with minimal steps) is essential to rewards.  

As a status report, we decided to change the baseline of our progress such that our baseline is to have an agent that makes random moves. After accomplishing the baseline for this stage, the agent is able to find the exit in a minimal number of steps. Currently, we have not implemented any resources on the map.
